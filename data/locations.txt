1	It is a hot day by the riverbank of a not-so-important river. Your name is 
1	Alice and you are sitting with your elder sister. You are growing tired and 
1	bored when you spot a white rabbit running past you. 
2	You are in front of a seemingly unremarkable hedge, where had you not seen 
2	the white rabbit already jump into the rabbit hole you may not had known it 
2	was there. The rabbit hole is curiously large, it seems as though you could hop 
2	into it with no struggle, but then again that white rabbit was rather large... 
3	Now, you are in a free fall; however you don't seem to be falling quite fast. 
3	The walls of the tunnel are filled with shelves of books. You tried to fetch 
3	a jar off of one of the shelves, but you instead knocked it down. Curiously, it 
3	is falling much faster than you. Finally, you land softly in a rather basic room 
3	with a long hall, a table, and a door much too small to enter. The jar - full 
3	of jam - lies unharmed in front of you, alongside a bottle labelled 'Drink me.' 
4	You're not sure why you're obeying The White Rabbit, yet here you are at his 
4	house, returning his possessions. It is a rather unremarkable house, though you 
4	aren't sure what sort of house you'd expect for a rabbit. On the counter you 
4	spot a bottle filled with what appears to be water. 
5	After running until your feet hurt, you suddenly become aware of your 
5	surroundings and find you are in a rather dense forest. You see two paths, but 
5	they are thick with bushes and trees and you'd rather not wander and find 
5	youself at the wrath of The White Rabbit again. You spot a third, lighter, path 
5	that has smoke dancing towards you. There seems to be a nice spot here to empty your pockets. 
6	Following the smoke as it grows heavier and heavier you find a caterpillar 
6	enjoying a rather large hookah. It is lounging against a tree and, beside it, 
6	a rather large mushroom sticks out of the centre of the clearing. 
7	You stand outside the house in amazement at its elegance. Going inside to plead 
7	for help on how to get home, you find the Duchess, her baby, and a strange 
7	looking cat. Of the three, the Duchess seems to be the best option for help. 
8	The tea party certainly wasn't hard to find once it was within eyeshot. It's a 
8	simple table in tthe middle of the clearing. Pastries, sandwiches, and, of 
8	course, tea fill the table. Sat around the table is a fellow in quite the 
8	eclectic hat who muct be the Hatter, as well as a dormouse and a march hare. 
8	They seem to be in the midst of a lively conversation. 
9	You find youself in an elegant garden, filled with vibrant red roses. Looking 
9	around, you notice several croquet loops stuck in the perfectly manicured 
9	grass. Humanoid playing cards are hitting hedgehogs through them with 
9	flamingoes... Of all the things in this strange land, this sight is the 
9	strangest of them all. Finally, you spot a woman in a decorus gown and what 
9	seems to be a very heavy crown atop her head. Perhaps she has answers for you. 
10	The Gryphon shoves you into the castle, with the halls lined with statues of 
10	playing cards and portraits of the Queen of Hearts. Bouquets of red roses, 
10	seemingly real, are plentiful. 
11	The Gryphon shoves you on a stand at the head of the trial hall. It seems as 
11	though you are on trial for... something. You can spot the Duchess, the Hatter, 
11	and even the White Rabbit among the seats in the room. Looking beside - and 
11	above - you, the Queen of Hearts sits at a very high podium, looking like she 
11	wants to kill you.
