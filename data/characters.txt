1	White Rabbit
000	'Oh Dear, oh dear! I'm so very late!' The White Rabbit cries as he scurries to 
000	a hedge and disappears. Wherever could he have gone?
100	The White Rabbit cries in surprise and scampers off, dropping his gloves and a 
100	fan.
200	'You! You there!' The White Rabbit barks. 'Bring me my gloves and fan. They 
200	shall be at my house.'
300	The White Rabbit and his neighbours are throwing pebbles at you! Although up 
300	close they look like cakes.
400	The White Rabbit stands and announces, 'here stands the accused and we shall 
400	determine if she is guilty of painting the roses red! How do you plead?'
2	Caterpillar
000	'Whooo... Are... You?' The Caterpillar inquires while blowing smoke into your 
000	face.
100	You are flustered by the Caterpillar's question, and struggle to explain your 
100	predicament.
100	'What do you mean by that?' The Caterpillar countered.
200	You go back and forth with the Caterpillar, who you learned isn't fond of 
200	becoming a butterfly and is rather sticky about poetry.
200	'Well. I cannot help you.' The Caterpillar sighs as he begins to crawl away. 
200	'One side makes you taller, whilst the other makes you grow shorter.' 
200	What is he talking about? There's nothing here now but the mushroom.
300	The Caterpillar is gone. 
3	Duchess
000	The Duchess is nursing her baby, acting rather annoyed at it. You introduce 
000	yourself and begin to ask the Duchess for help, but she stops you rather abruptly. 
100	'I said I don't have time for this! You nurse this baby!' The Duchess sounded 
100	quite annoyed as she shoved the baby into your arms. You jump in surprise as it 
100	turns to a piglet. Before you could object, the Duchess was storming down the 
100	hall out of sight.
200	The Duchess is gone. 
4	Cheshire Cat
000	Upon releasing the piglet, the Cheshire Cat suddenly apprears in front of you, 
000	showcasing a rather unsettling grin. 'You know,' He says softly, 'the Hatter 
000	and March Hare are down that way. Perhaps you may find something of value 
000	there? Of course, they're mad.'
100	The Cheshire Cat chuckles at your reacting to the Hatter and Hare being mad. 
100	'We're all mad here. I'm not all there myself.' The Cheshire Cat dissapears. 
100	Perhaps you should just find the Hatter and Hare.
200	The Cheshire cat is gone. 
5	Hatter
000	'Oh! And who might you be?' The hatter chimed, despite starting intensly at you 
000	since you had arrived.
100	'The Dormouse is asleep.' The Hatter points out. 'I'm sure his sweet tooth will 
100	awaken him soon.'
200	The hatter interjects, 'I know not of what you speak about. I am mad, after 
200	all.' You grow frustrated, and turning away to leave you notice a door on a tree. 
6	March Hare
000	'There is no room here!' The March hare states indignantly as you approach the 
000	table. 'There is only room for three.'
100	You try to protest on account of how large the table is and how much food is 
100	there, but the March Hare interrupts, 'we put enough food and have the table 
100	large enough for us three!. There is no room!'
200	The Dormouse takes a sniff, and blearily blinks his eyes open as he licks the 
200	jam of his nose. The March Hare turns your attention by yelling 'are you here 
200	for something, or do you just wish to interrupt us?'
7	Queen of Hearts
000	'Oh! Hello, dear!' The woman called. 'Do play croquet with us!'
100	The womans kind, joyous demeanor was replaced with fury at your response. 'I am 
100	the Queen of Hearts, girl! And I will not be addressed by anything other than Your 
100	Majesty and a curtsey!'
200	'Good hit,' the Queen of Hearts says as the hedgehog makes good distance. She then 
200	screeches in anger. 'WHAT is that?' She demands.
300	'How DARE you pluck one of my roses!' The Queen of Hearts screams. 'And its 
300	painted too?' She turns to the guards, her face red with anger. 'Which one of 
300	you painted my roses?' One guard looked more guilty than the rest and the 
300	Queen pointed her finger at him. 'Off with his head!' She turned back to you. 
400	'If you are so insistent that you did not pluck this rose, then we shall find 
400	out in trial.' You curtsy at the Queen's mercy. She turns to the castle's 
400	entrance. 'Gryphon! Take this girl to trial.'
500	'She's guilty! Off with her head!' The Queen screeched. You tried to argue 
500	more, but the people - and animals - of the court swarm you, violently 
500	chanting your name.
8	Gryphon
000	'Now then, Alice,' the Gryphon starts. How he knows your name is beyond you. 
000	'We must get your story straight for Her Majesty. Did you pluck the flower?' 
100	The Gryphon seemingly ignored your protests of finding it on the ground as he 
100	continued, 'I must admit, it doesn't look great for you, Alice. The Queen is 
100	hardly proven wrong, and she takes her roses very seriously.' The Gryphon seems 
100	deep in thought, but also uncaring. 'Well, best of luck!' He states cheerfully 
100	as he shoves you into the trial hall.
